# Loan Default Prediction App (Group 5)

This is a **Streamlit-based machine learning app** that predicts the likelihood of loan default.  
It includes full workflow steps: data upload, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interactive prediction.

---

##  How to Run

Install required libraries (if needed):

    pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib

Then run the app:

    streamlit run Group_5.py

---

##  Features

- Upload any loan dataset with a `Status` column (0 = non-default, 1 = default)
- Visualize numeric distributions and outliers
- Automatically preprocess missing values, categorical encodings, scaling
- Use **RandomForestClassifier** for fast, accurate feature selection
- Train and evaluate Random Forest model (metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Make interactive predictions and view default risk level

---

##  File Structure

- Group_5.py â€” âœ… Entire Streamlit app
- saved_data/ â€” Stores intermediate files, models, and outputs

---

##  Risk Thresholds

- **High Risk**: Probability > 30%
- **Medium Risk**: 10% â€“ 30%
- **Low Risk**: < 10%
